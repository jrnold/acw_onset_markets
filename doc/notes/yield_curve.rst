- Seven thirties (1861-1884):
- One year (old): unusual behavior in ytm due to the change in policy regarding the payment of interest.
- Five-twentites. Callable; not enough data (first prices in 1865)
- Ten-forties. Callable; not enough data (first prices in 1865)


Yield Curve estimation
========================

Most 

Problems

- Only about two / 3 bonds per time period suitable for estimating a yield curve. The seven-thirties have unusual 
- Likely too costly computationally, and annoying computationally to directly estimate the yield curve using prices.
  I could no longer use
