The Reduction of Fort Pulaski Its Lesson and Importance.,"The whole country has been somewhat led astray by an item of news coming via Fortress Monroe, which was relied upon as correct because bearing the sanction of Government censorship. The Seminole, on arriving there from the South, was reported as authentically announcing that the garrison of Fort Pulaski had offered to surrender the fort if they could be allowed to retire with the honors of war, and that the proposal had been rejected by Gen. SHERMAN. It was further stated that the unconditional surrender of the fort was daily expected. Both these assertions prove to have been untrue.",91633922,Historical Newspapers,," Copyright New York Times Company May 4, 1862"," 78687904 , 1445947 , 113715", editorial_article," May 4, 1862",0362-4331, English, English, 4," New York, N.Y.","May 4, 1862",New York Times (1857-1922),1862,http://search.proquest.com/docview/91633922?accountid=10747, 4,http://sfxhosted.exlibrisgroup.com/emu?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=unknown&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahnpnewyorktimes&amp;atitle=The+Reduction+of+Fort+Pulaski+Its+Lesson+and+Importance.&amp;title=New+York+Times+%281857-1922%29&amp;issn=03624331&amp;date=1862-05-04&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=4&amp;au=&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=New+York+Times+%281857-1922%29&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/,ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The New York Times (1851-2009)
